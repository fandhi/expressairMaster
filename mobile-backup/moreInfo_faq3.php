                <span style="color:#333;">Baggage Claim Areas</span><br />
                Order and priority for unloading is determined by cabin class flown and loading position. Please allow 10-50 minutes for your baggage to be delivered to the claim area. <br />
                To ensure that you don’t take someone else’s identical or similar-looking luggage by mistake, please double-check the tag number on the suitcase to be certain it has your baggage before you take it from the conveyor.
