                            Express Air is East Indonesia's favorite airline. Our daily scheduled service began on June 26th 2003, from Jakarta to Jayapura.
                        </span>

                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Since then, Express Air, with its two Boeing 737s, has became the first privately owned, scheduled airlines connecting Jakarta, Makassar(formerly known as Ujung Pandang), Ternate, Sorong, Manokwari, and Jayapura . Express Air is currently in the process of a major fleet expansion, with 32 seats Dornier 328 turbo-prop, a modern advance high performance aircraft with latest technology on board to serve number of destinations along West -East Papua axis, Sulawesi, Maluku, and Nusa Tenggara. The 1 st Dornier 328 TP aircraft will enter operation in May 2008, and Expressair will have a total of 6 aircrafts by the end of 2008.

                        Whether our customers are in the air or on the ground, Express Air takes pride in providing a full service experience. The smaller aircraft also permits our cabin crew to offer a more attentive service to our passengers. Passengers have more room in the cabin than any other regional jet with genereous seating space offering plenty of shoulder and legroom and a full standing height of 6 feet, 2 inches (1.88m), allowing passengers to travel in a completely relaxed, friendly, and comfortable environment.
