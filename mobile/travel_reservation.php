                <h5>How to Make a Reservation & Purchase a Ticket</h5>
                <br />
                <p>There are five convenient methods to purchase a Garuda Indonesia ticket through our on-line payment system: ATM, Phone Banking, Internet Banking, Mobile Banking, or Visa or MasterCard. You can also purchase a ticket from a travel agent or directly from a Garuda Indonesia branch office.</p>

                <div style="margin-left:17px;">
                    <h6>Step 1.</h6>
                    <br />
                    <p>Call the Garuda Indonesia 24-hour Call Center and make a reservation. You will receive a Passenger Name 		Reference number (PNR) and a 13-digit payment code.</p>
                    <h6>Step 2.</h6>
                    <br />
                    <p>Pay for the ticket using any of the following methods:</p>
                    <ul style="color:#777;">
                        <li>ATM machines of Bank Central Asia (BCA), Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI), Bank Mandiri, Bank Niaga, Lippo 	Bank, 	Permata Bank. Bank BRI.</li>

                    <p>If payment is made by ATM machine, you will receive a confirmation of payment slip. If payment is made by 		Phone Banking, Internet Banking, or Mobile Banking, no paper record will be provided.</p>
                    <p>To pay by credit card, you may call the Garuda Indonesia 24-hour Call Center and key in your 16-digit credit card number to authorize payment.</p>
                    <p>With the introduction of e-tickets (electronic tickets or paperless tickets) by Garuda Indonesia on all domestic flights and flights to Singapore originating in Jakarta, a traditional paper ticket is no longer required.</p>
                    <h6>Step 3.</h6>

                    <p>
                        Upon arrival at the airport, present your passport or identity card at the check-in counter and proceed to the boarding gate. <br />
                        In any circumstances where a paper ticket is needed, a Garuda Indonesia branch office or Airport Ticketing Office may issue a ticket or itinerary receipt upon request.
